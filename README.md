carto-manual
============


This started out as reference notes that I made for myself or found in mapbox's support or #mapbox over the years, 
to learn carto which is used in tilemill. 


It's an expansion or sequel to the Carto manuals at http://www.mapbox.com/tilemill/docs/manual/carto/ and other things like: 
http://www.mapbox.com/tilemill/docs/guides/symbol-drawing-order/ 


Designed for intermediate users of Tilemill. 

License TBD.

It's sort of a mess in organization and some of it I rewrote for other users, some is still written for myself, 
and some of it is just copy and pasted from IRC conversations or mapbox support, so the formatting is hard to read. 
some of it may even be wrong, or using the wrong terms.
